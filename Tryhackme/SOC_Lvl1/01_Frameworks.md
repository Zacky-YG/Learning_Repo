# Section 1: Cyber Defence Frameworks
- Understanding different type of cyber security frameworks
## Pyramid of Pain
- Hash Values
  - Gain insight via hashes
  - Identify signatures to attribute payloads and artefacts to an actor.
-- IP Address
  - Fast Faux: A group of networks constantly changing their network details, making it diffcult to track and identify source.

--- Domain Names
  - Name mapped to IP addresses for identification.
---- Host Artifacts
----- Network Artifacts
  - Attack using user-agent string, C2 info, or URI patterns followed by HTTP POST requests.
------ Tools
  - E.g. exe, dll, payloads etc.

# Cyber Kill Chain
## Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
  - An attacker studies the victim's information before proceeding with an attack plan.
## Weaponization
  - macro, payloads etc.
## Delivery
  - Method of transmitting payload.
## Exploitation
  - Using resources such as emails and phishing links to obtain victim data.
## Installation
  - Creating a backdoor after a successful attempt in accessing victim's system.
  - Timestomping: used to avoid detection by modifying create/access/change times.
## Command & Control (C2)
  - C&C or C2 Beaconing is a type of mailicious communication to establish a channel for control over victim's system.
  - DNS Tunneling: victim system makes constant DNS request to the DNS server to maintain full control.
## Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)
  - Attacker performs their desired actions on a system such as collecting credentials or sensitive data.

# Unified Kill Chain
  - Understand behaviors and methodlogiesof a cyber threat to establish strong cybersecurity def/posture.
## What is "Kill Chain"
  - Methodlogy/path attackers use to approach and intrude a target.
## What is "Threat Modelling"
  - Series of steps to improve system security.
## What is "Unified Kill Chain"
  - 18 Attack Phases
  - Created 2017, updated 2022.
  - meant to complement other defence framework.
  - Refer to "Paul Pols' Unified Kill Chain.png" for details on all 18 attack phases.
## Phase: In (Initial Foothold)
  - Refer to "THM - Initial Foothold.png" for chart.
  1. Reconnaissance: Gather Info on target.
  2. Weaponization: Setup infrastructure for attack.
  3. Social Engineering: Used to manipulate victims into performing certain actions to aid attack.
  4. Exploitation: Takes advantage of vulnerabilities.
  5. Persistence: Maintain backdoor.
  6. Defence Evasion: Understand blue team techniques and evade.
  7. Command & Control: Execute what had been planned during Weaponization phase.
  8. Pivoting: Reach other systems within a network through most vulnerable point.
## Phase: Through (Network Propagation)
  - Refer to "THM - Through.png" for chart.
  1. Pivoting: Staging site and tunnel between a victim's network. A distribution point for backdoor.
  2. Discovery: Uncover victim's network and other information such as active user accounts.
  3. Privilege Escalation: Attempt to gain more information via privleged access.
  4. Execution: Deploy malicious code using the pivot system as their host such as remote trojans, C2 scripts or schedule tasks to maintain persistence.
  5. Credential Access: Steals credentials to use it as a mask for more attacks.
  6. Lateral Movement: Move to another victim's system once done with current system.
## Phase: Out (Action on Objectives)
  1. Collection: Gather all valuable data of interest.
  2. Exfiltration: Attempts stealing valuable data via Command & Control (C2) channel and tunnel deployed in the earlier phases.
  3. Impact: As data lose its integrity, attacker will manipulate assets to cause business distruption. For example ransomware, denial of service (DoS) attacks.
  4. Objectives: With power and access to the system and network, attacker can choose to perform other goals which may include releasing confidential data to the public.

# Diamond Model
  - 4 Core Features
      - Adversary
      - Infrastructure
      - Capability
      - Victim
  - 2 Addon Features
      - Social,
      - Political and Technology
## Adversary
- aka attacker
## Victim
- Victim Personae: The target.
## Infrastructure
- Type 1: Controlled by adversary
- Type 2: Intermediary, infrastructure may not be aware it is a used for mailicious actions. (e.g. compromised email accounts)
## Event Meta Features (6 possible features)
1. Timestamp
2. Phase
3. Result
4. Direction
5. Methodology: Descrribe general classification of intrusion.
6. Resources: external resources used for attack to succeed.
  - Software
  - Knowledge
  - Information
  - Hardware
  - Funds
  - Facilities
## Social-Political Component
- The intent and needs of the adversary

## Basic Terminology
- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): A team/group who engages in long-term attack against organizations and/or countries.
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP)
  - Tactic: adversary's goal
  - Technique: how adversary achieve goals
  - Procedure: how the techniques are executed.
- Tools available: https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attack-data-and-tools/
## Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)
- Knowlege base of analytics by MITRE.

# Section 2: Cyber Threat Intelligence
- 3 Essentials Qs
  1. Who, or what is on the other end of this alert indcator
  2. What was their behavior in the past?
  3. How does the org respond, and what should i do about it right now?
- Information Security can be split to 3 points
  - Data: Capture artefact.
  - Info: Record attributes.
  - Intelligence: Escalate/surpress.
- 3 types of labels
  1. Indicator of Compromise (IOC): Breach evidence.
  2. Indicator of Attack (IOA): Mailcious action.
  3. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP): detail methodologies express in MITRE ATT&CK IDs and descriptions

  - Strategic: Looks into threat landscape (e.g. randomware trends)
  - Tactical: Behaviors analysis via TTP (e.g. Advisory notes)
  - Operational: Intent and motives
  - Technical: indicators and artefacts such as IP address and hashes related to attack.
